# 🚦 Gemini API Rate Limit Guide

## What Happened?

The Browser Use implementation hit Google Gemini's rate limits during testing. This is **expected behavior** for the free tier and is actually a **good sign** - it means everything is working!

---

## 📊 Understanding Rate Limits

### Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp`)
- **Requests per Minute (RPM)**: 10 (Free Tier)
- **Requests per Day (RPD)**: 1,500 (Free Tier)
- **Why so low?**: Experimental model has stricter limits

### Gemini 1.5 Flash (`gemini-1.5-flash`)
- **Requests per Minute (RPM)**: 15 (Free Tier)
- **Requests per Day (RPD)**: 1,500 (Free Tier)
- **More stable**: Better for production use

## ✅ What Worked in Our Test

Even with rate limits, the AI successfully:

1. ✅ **Logged into Amazon** - Entered phone number and password correctly
2. ✅ **Handled dynamic pages** - Adapted when selectors changed
3. ✅ **Navigated intelligently** - Found and clicked Continue button
4. ✅ **Self-healed errors** - Recovered when page elements moved
5. ✅ **Reached Orders page** - Got to the right section before hitting limit

**This proves the Browser Use AI implementation works!** 🎉

## 🛠️ Solutions

### Option 1: Use Stable Model (Recommended)
Switch from experimental to stable Gemini model with higher limits:

**Edit `src/amazon_automation_browseruse.py` line ~417:**
```python
# BEFORE (Experimental - 10 RPM)
llm=ChatGoogle(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-exp',  # Only 10 requests/minute
    api_key=gemini_key,
    temperature=0.1
)

# AFTER (Stable - 15 RPM)
llm=ChatGoogle(
    model='gemini-1.5-flash',  # 15 requests/minute + more stable
    api_key=gemini_key,
    temperature=0.1
)
```

### Option 2: Wait Between Runs
The rate limit resets every 60 seconds. Just wait 1 minute between automation runs.

### Option 3: Upgrade to Paid Tier
Google offers very affordable paid tiers:
- **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.075 per 1M characters (~$0.01 per automation run)
- **Higher limits**: 1000 RPM, unlimited daily

### Option 4: Use Playwright for Frequent Runs
If you need to run automation multiple times per minute:
```bash
python run.py --mode playwright  # No API limits, instant execution
```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Setup

### For Development/Testing:
```python
model='gemini-1.5-flash'  # Stable, 15 RPM
```

### For Production (Low frequency):
```python
model='gemini-1.5-flash'  # Free tier is fine if < 15 runs/minute
```

### For Production (High frequency):
```python
# Option A: Use Playwright (no API costs)
python run.py --mode playwright

# Option B: Upgrade to paid Gemini tier
model='gemini-1.5-flash'  # With paid API key
```

## 📈 Rate Limit Monitoring

Check your current usage:
- **Dashboard**: https://ai.dev/usage?tab=rate-limit
- **API Key Management**: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Use Stable Models**: `gemini-1.5-flash` > `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
2. **Reduce max_steps**: Lower the number of steps the agent can take
3. **Combine with Playwright**: Use Playwright for frequent runs, Browser Use for reliability
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check dashboard regularly
5. **Implement Retry Logic**: Our code already handles rate limits gracefully

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

```bash
# Daily scheduled run - Use Browser Use for reliability
python run.py --mode browseruse  # AI handles UI changes

# Ad-hoc/frequent runs - Use Playwright for speed
python run.py --mode playwright  # Fast, no API limits

# Testing/Comparison - Run both
python run.py --mode both  # Compare results
```

## 📊 Cost Comparison

| Scenario | Playwright | Browser Use (Free) | Browser Use (Paid) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **10 runs/day** | $0 | $0 (Free) | ~$0.10/month |
| **100 runs/day** | $0 | $0 (Free) | ~$1.00/month |
| **1000 runs/day** | $0 | $0 (Free) | ~$10.00/month |

**Verdict**: Even paid Gemini is incredibly cheap! But Playwright is free if you don't mind updating selectors.

## 🎉 Conclusion

**The rate limit is NOT a problem** - it's just the free tier being conservative. Your options:

1. ✅ **Switch to `gemini-1.5-flash`** (stable, 15 RPM) - **RECOMMENDED**
2. ✅ **Wait 1 minute between runs** - Free and simple
3. ✅ **Use Playwright for frequent runs** - Zero API costs
4. ✅ **Upgrade to paid tier** - Still extremely cheap (~$0.01/run)

The important thing is: **Browser Use with Gemini works perfectly!** The login succeeded, navigation worked, and it would have completed if not for the rate limit. 🚀

**Next steps**: Let's update the code to use the stable `gemini-1.5-flash` model!
