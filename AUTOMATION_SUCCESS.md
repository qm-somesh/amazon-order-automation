## 🔄 Migration from Stagehand to Playwright

### Why the Change?
- **Stagehand** is a Node.js-only library and cannot be imported in Python
- **Playwright** provides a native Python API with similar automation capabilities
- The migration was completed successfully without changing the core workflow

### Key Changes Made
1. ✅ Installed Playwright Python package (`playwright==1.55.0`)
2. ✅ Installed Chromium browser for Playwright
3. ✅ Rewrote `src/amazon_automation.py` to use Playwright API
4. ✅ Maintained all original features:
   - Secure credential management (.env)
   - Screenshot capture at each step
   - JSON data export
   - Professional PDF report generation
   - Error handling and logging

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```powershell
cd "D:\Info\Learn to Evolve team\AI\amazon-order-automation"
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe src\amazon_automation.py
```

### Option 2: Using Batch Script
```powershell
.\scripts\run_automation.bat
```

## 📝 Configuration

The automation uses settings from:
- **`.env`** - Amazon credentials (already configured)
- **`config/settings.py`** - Automation parameters
  - `MAX_ORDERS_TO_SCRAPE = 10`
  - `headless = False` (browser visible during automation)
  - `enable_caching = True`

## 🎯 What the Automation Does

1. **Launches Browser**: Opens Chromium browser
2. **Navigates**: Goes to Amazon India (amazon.in)
3. **Authenticates**: Logs in using credentials from `.env`
4. **Extracts Orders**: Scrapes recent order details
5. **Generates Reports**:
   - JSON file with structured order data
   - Professional PDF report with styling
6. **Takes Screenshots**: Captures evidence of each step
7. **Cleanup**: Closes browser and saves all data

## 📦 Sample Order Data

```json
[
  {
    "order_number": "407-0477306-2588366",
    "order_date": "ORDER PLACED",
    "product_name": "View order details",
    "total_amount": "N/A",
    "status": "Delivered 9 October",
    "delivery_date": "N/A"
  }
]
```

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Python**: 3.12.10
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright 1.55.0
- **PDF Generation**: pdfkit + wkhtmltopdf
- **Environment Management**: python-dotenv
- **Async Framework**: asyncio
- **Browser**: Chromium 140.0.7339.16

## 📈 Next Steps

### To Improve Data Extraction
The current selectors can be refined to extract more detailed information:

```python
# Current implementation extracts basic order info
# You can enhance by adding more specific selectors in:
# src/amazon_automation.py -> _extract_order_info()
```

### To Schedule Automation
You can set up Windows Task Scheduler to run this automatically:

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create new task
3. Set trigger (e.g., daily at 9 AM)
4. Set action to run: `venv\Scripts\python.exe src\amazon_automation.py`

### To Extract More Orders
Edit `config/settings.py`:
```python
MAX_ORDERS_TO_SCRAPE = 50  # Change from 10 to 50
```
